# Project: Create and Mint Token
In this project, we have to create our own token on a local HardHat network and using remix we will interact with it.
The contract owner will be able to mint tokens to a provided address and user can burn and transfer tokens.

# Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In this contract we can mint, burn and transfer tokens. This contarct helps in developing a better understanding and logic for Solidity programming.

# Getting Started

1. To run this program, You have to first create local Hardhat network.
2. Run these commands inside the terminal where project is located.
3. The Commands are:
   npx hardhat node
   npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
4. Now, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
5. Create a new file _name.sol and then change environment to Dev -Hardhat.
6. compile the file and deploy.
